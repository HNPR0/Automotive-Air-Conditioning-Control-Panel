## Embedded Systems Project Report: [Embedded AC Control System]

## 1. Introduction

The Embedded AC Control System is designed to provide automated temperature regulation for enclosed spaces by integrating sensor data acquisition, user interaction, and actuator control. The system allows precise control over ambient temperature using a combination of a temperature sensor, DC motor-driven fan, keypad and push-button inputs, and a visual display. It also incorporates data storage and optional cloud-based analytics to monitor system performance and temperature trends over time. The project demonstrates the application of embedded systems principles, microcontroller interfacing, and real-time control in a cost-effective, modular design.
